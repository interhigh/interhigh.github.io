As part of our worship service, we deliver Bible-based messages that are relevant to the youth and the issues they face today. We develop the curriculum based on the various needs of our students, including basic knowledge of the Bible, appreciating the importance of the church community, understanding and critiquing the mass media culture, and apologetics and worldview training. We incorporate interactive activities, videos, and discussions so the students may be motivated to learn about God and how his teachings apply to their lives. Finally, we include the teaching of daily devotions and prayers in our curriculum so that students can learn to walk with God in their daily lives.
