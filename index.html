Hello pastors, fellow ministers, and parents:
<br><br>
We are InterHigh, a ministry fully dedicated to provide Sunday programs to youths at local churches that are under-resourced and currently do not have youth ministers or staff to serve their youths.  We want to help—by bringing youth-centric Sunday worship service, fun fellowship time, and youth mentoring to each of these local churches every Sunday.   
<br><br>
Our InterHigh youth teachers and volunteers are trained to serve middle and high school students at the local churches, and are passionate to teach these students about the love of God and the Gospel Message of Jesus Christ.  Our messages are specifically tailored to address the youths about the relevance of the Gospel Message in their life, as they face strong influence from the media and today’s youth culture, as well as a highly stressful and competitive academic environment.   Our previous message curriculum includes topics such as “What Does It Mean to Have a Personal Relationship with Jesus?”; “Tough Questions about Faith & Christianity”; “Old Testament Survey”; “Jesus & the Cross”; “Heroes of Faith” and many more.  Our InterHigh Sunday program emphasizes relationship-building among the students at each of the local churches, youth mentorship with InterHigh’s trained teachers, and service opportunities at the local churches.     
<br><br>
[Show testimonies of students/parents/pastors narrating and appreciating the impacts of InterHigh]. 
<br><br>
Our hope and prayer is that each of these youth students, through their participation in the InterHigh Sunday program at their local churches, will be trained and equipped to become strong Christ-followers, as well as servants and a source of blessing to their home churches.  Come join us!
