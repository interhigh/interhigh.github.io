The mission of InterHigh is to equip local Christian youth and raise them to become Biblically-minded Christ-followers. In addition, we are mindful of those who might not be familiar with Christianity. Thus, we incorporate Christian foundations in our instruction so that they may come to a personal knowledge of Christ. We provide Sunday programs in a setting where the youth can be mentored by youth workers who are passionate about youth ministry. Our hope is that our students will enter college and life beyond armed with the ability to defend their faith and to make an impact in the lives of the people around them. Finally, we hope that as we train and equip our youth, they will, in turn, become servants and a blessing to their home churches.
